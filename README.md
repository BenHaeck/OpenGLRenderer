# MeshMaker
An abstraction of OpenTK. The idea is to make it relatively easy to generate meshes
# WIP
this is a work in progress.

You could probably use this to make a game, but it's still not ready yet.
Also the shader system is a bit odd.

OpenTK not included, if you want to use this you need to download opentk seperately

Also this is not a renderer, its something you make a renderer out of
